Scala is object-oriented (every value is an object) and functional (every function is a value). 
So every function is an object.

Scala is compiled into Java Byte Code which is executed by JVM. Scala and Java have a common runtime platform.

When using Mac, create HelloWorld.scala file, then open terminal, it shows this error:
~/Desktop$ scalac HelloWorld.scala 
~/Desktop$ scala HelloWorld
No such file or class on classpath: HelloWorld

That is because the Java env in Mac does not set up correctly.
~/Desktop$ scala -cp . HelloWorld
Hello World

Scala Packages: A package is a named module of code.

Scala Variable Declaration: Syntax
val or var VariableName: DataType = [Initial Value]

Scala supports multiple assignments:
val (myVar1: Int, myVar2: String) = Pair(40, "Foo")
It returns a tuple (Holds collection of Objects of different types)

Variables in Scala can have three different scopes: fields, method parameters, local variables.

Fields: variables that belong to an object.
Method Parameters: variables which are used to pass the value inside a method, when the method is called.
Local variables: variables that declared inside a method.
